               Fans have long been waiting and anticipating a new version Counter-Strike, Counter Strike Global Offensive (CSGO) did change Counter-Strike forever but it wasn't until a new competitor for Counter-Strike
               was made, Valorant which was made by Riot Games then shook the tables which caused some CSGO Professional players had switched to Valorant. The playerbase dropped as players
               then switched to valorant due to the reason that Valorant has more frequent update than CSGO as well it looked more modern.

            <p class="description">
                Finally, 'Touchstone' maps, such as the original Dust 2, are used to showcase some of the visual differences between CSGO and CS2, and have gotten a modest upgrade in terms of some effects and textures, 
                but otherwise remain untouched. In Counter-Strike 2, community map developers will have access to all of the Source 2 tools and rendering features.
