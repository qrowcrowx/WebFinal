                    <P> Half Life is a science fiction first person shooter published by Valve at November 19,1998. The player takes the perspective of a scientist called
                        Gordon Freeman. Involved in a failed experiment which caused a rift portal to Xen, an otherworldly place where aliens inhabit the planet. Freeman then tries
                        to find his way to look for help and a way out of the underground facility. Throughout his journey, he would meet fellow scientist and soldiers that will help
                        freeman to escape the facility and call the government for reinforcements however, the government already has plants to contain the incident and thus called

                    <p>
                        The impact of Half-Life on the game industry is well-known since it popularized the idea of planned sequences,
                         introducing memorable set-piece moments that have since become common in current games. 
                         game's popularity generated expansions and sequels, including the critically acclaimed Half-Life 2.
                    </p> <br>

                    <p>
                       The Gameplay is quite simple, most of the time you will travel locations in search of an exit to call for reinforcements, aliens will be on your way to
                       stop and hinder your adventure. But you are not unarmed throughout the whole-game as you will find weapons every now and then which will help you pave
                       your way to the upper surface. 
                    </p> <br>

                    <p>
                        Overall, Half-Life may seem too old and definitely different from the usual modern games however, It was one of the best on it's prime years it's considered
                        as one of the best first person shooter  with a story full of wonder and loopholes. The mysterious Gman is still unknown up until this day, there are only
                        few information about him and the information that supports his identity are rather vague. The flow of the game may seem a bit confusing since there are quest
                        paths and you will manually explore and think thorough to progress. Despite these negative feedbacks, it is still worth to try! Quake, Counter-Strike were maiden
                        through the use of Half-Life 1's in game asset and engine so you will definitely enjoy half-life if you have played either Quake, Counter-Strike or Team Fortress.
