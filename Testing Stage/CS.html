            <p class="intro">
                Counter-Strike (CS) is a series of multiplayer tactical first-person shooter video games in which teams of terrorists battle to perpetrate an act of terror 
                (bombing, hostage-taking, assassination) while counter-terrorists try to prevent it (bomb defusal, hostage rescue, escort mission).
                Counter-Strike began as a mod for Valve's Half-Life game. The game was created in 1999 by Minh "Gooseman" Le and Jess "Cliffe" Cliffe. 
                The mod's popularity peaked in 2000, when Valve purchased it with the intention of turning Counter-Strike into a full-fledged, standalone computer game.

            Counter-Strike: Condition Zero was released shortly after Counter-Strike. It was published in 2004 to lukewarm reviews, in contrast to Counter-Strike, which was critically lauded. 
            Condition Zero, like the previous game, used Half-Life's GoldSrc engine.
            Turtle Rock Studios created Condition Zero, which had a full in-universe campaign as well as multiplayer features.

                Counter-Strike: Source was Valve's first commercially released game that used the Source engine. On August 11, 2004, Counter-Strike: Source was launched as a beta to participants of the Valve Cyber Caf√© Program. 
                On August 18, 2004, the beta was made available to Counter-Strike: Condition Zero owners and those who had obtained a Half-Life 2 voucher with the purchase of some ATI Radeon visual cards. 
                While the game was initially exclusively available for Microsoft Windows, it was ultimately ported to OS X on June 23, 2010, followed by a Linux adaptation in 2013.

        <p class="description">
            On release, Global Offensive garnered excellent reviews from critics, who lauded the game for its gameplay and fidelity to the Counter-Strike series, 
            however several early features and inconsistencies between the console and PC versions were questioned. 
            Since its release, it has attracted an estimated 11 million monthly players and remains one of the most popular games on Valve's Steam platform. 
            Valve converted the game to a free-to-play model in December 2018, focused on revenue from cosmetic items.
