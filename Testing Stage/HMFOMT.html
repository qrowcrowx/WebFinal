                    <P> Harvest moon: More Friends of Mineral Town is the third game that focuses on the female perspective
                        like every Harvest Moon game, you cultivate crops and raise animals, befriend the various villagers of Mineral Town and there are 8 bachelors of
                        your choice to marry. There are also optional events and festivals to attend to.

                <div class="lmao">
                    <p>
                        The story begins as you are in your apartment sitting all alone and thinking about how tired you are on your life in the city. Wanting something new,
                        your character then went to look for newspaper and saw the opportunity to live in a farm which was for sale. The player then met Mayor Thomas who is surprised
                        to see someone actually bought the farm despite in its worse condition, the player then decides to live in the farm and throughout the whole years will continue
                        to flourish.
                    </p>

                    </div> <br>

                    <p>
                        The Game was release in 2005 for Game Boy Advance system, and has a simple gameplay mechanics, You are not required to farm but it is a feature
                        most players will do since it is the point of the game, a simulation farming role-playing game. The player can also forage items throughout the whole Town
                        which they can sell to gain money. Another thing is they can also take care of Animals such as Chicken, Cow, Sheep and etc.

                    </p> <br>

                    <p>
                        It is a tedious process of watering crops everyday, foraging for items, talking to your fellow townsfolk and mining and cutting trees for materials
                         to upgrade your tools. But the catch is that you have an invisible energy meter which your character shows a sign of fatigue whenever they're tired or 
                         can't go on and do more labors. One of the few goal is to marry specific bachelor which you will have to court by giving gifts and talking to them regularly
                         But you won't be giving gifts without money right? That's why you will have to work for money.
                    </p> <br>

                    <p>
                       Marriage in game is not as easy as in real life (as if in real life was easier) Since you'll have to max-out your house's upgrades and furnitures as well
                       their heart-meter, You will only be able to ask-out a bachelor for marriage if their heart-meter is colored red. Harvest Moon is a pretty much relaxing game
                       with relaxing music too if you're looking for a casual game to just have fun and escape hardships in life once in awhile, Harvest Moon is your best beta as 
                       it offers a simple casual farming life.
