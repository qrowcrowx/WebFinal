            <h1 > Honkai Star Rail is a role-playing gacha video game developed by miHoYo and marketed globally by its subsidiary HoYoverse. 
                It was launched for Windows and mobile devices on April 26, 2023, with ports for PlayStation 4 and 5 planned.
                 It is the fourth installment in the Honkai series, drawing on characters from Honkai Impact 3rd and gameplay elements from Genshin Impact. </h1>

            <h1> 
                Star Rail's combat is turn base which means the team you are running may only attack once per round, the rule goes the same to your opponent. Star Rail is also a role-playing
                    which explains why the characters have Elements such as Fire, Wind, and Paths such as The Abundance, The Destruction and etc. The game is somewhat difficult, it really does make you think
                    about your next move, your opponent's, Scenarios such as should you heal, should you buff your team, play on defense, aggressively and etc. These said factors will benefit you for the longer runs
                    as it will help you understand certain situations where you will have to make a specific party to beat a specific boss or dungeon.

            <h1>
                The map is fairly large unlike genshin impact at release which they released massive content and treasures to be found. The difference between Star Rail and Genshin Impact is that genshin
                impact focuses on being an open world, free to explore on your own while Star Rail is different, exploration is not as open as genshin's and it is limited to zones per world, Treasures aren't that
                many as well although, Star Rail is released this year (2023), so updates are to be expected and much more content will be added into the game.

            </h1> <br>

            <h1>
                As the main character, you play as Trailblazer it can either be a Male or Female. They  then joined the Astral Express, a large train that travels through the galaxy to explore different
                worlds the trailblazer encounters the wonders of the world meeting new companions. First world ever visited with his new companions march 7th and dan heng, they 
                restored that certain world which was having a cold crisis. and after saving the day, moved to other planets to explore.


                The music in game both exploration and combat are truly music to your ears, they serve their purpose depending which scenario you are in, The view in game are all nicely well done, this includes
                every Location and Character designs, as well as skill effects, weapons and etc. Overall, We do recommend on trying the game out, It can be very grindy since it is an rpg, and it has a bigger world
                content to explore and quests to accomplish. Regardless if you are a casual player or a full-on gamer, Star Rail is definitely worth to try since specially it's free! The only time you will 
                spend real money is if you choose to buy in game currency to roll for characters or weapons.
