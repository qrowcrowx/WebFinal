                    <P> Shadow of the colossus, a classic Playstaion 2 Masterpiece released at October 27, 2005 (Japan) and sold-out 140,000 copies in it's first week in japan.
                        The game is rather simple, Wander the protagonist of the game had ventured off to The Forbidden Land in search of dormin, to revive mono a maiden who
                        was sacrificed for she had a cursed fate. Dormin, who is locked up in the Forbidden Land then agreed to ressurect the maiden, for the price of Wander's service
                        to defeat the 16 Colossi lingering around the Forbidden Land which will then destroy the idols around the Temple that holds dormin locked.
                    </p>
                </div> <br>

                <div class="lmao">
                    <p>
                     It is an Action-Adventure game however, It has a bit of platforming and puzzle since you will have to figure out every colossus's location, using your sword
                     that shines a light to where you will have to travel. Every colossus has same weakness, sigils that are hidden on their bodies which where the puzzle comes in,
                     You will have to these weakpoints through your sword as when it shine, it reveals where the weakspot is. At some point the colossi's mechanics gets more complex,
                     There will be times where you will have to use your Horse, Argo to reach certain spots to climb the colossus.

                    <p>
                        The game is praised as one of the "best video game ever made", Shadow of the Colossus is often regarded as an example of how a Video Game art is 
                        appreciated and should be used properly due to its minimalist landscape designs, character/enemies design, immersive gameplay which actually motivates
                        the player to think since every weakpoint and progression is different and it's music is well received by many. 

                    </p> <br>

                    <p>
                        Throughout your journey, You will find every colossal beings in their respecetive areas and you as the player had invaded their place and to destroy
                        these colossus for a single soul to exist once more. What we really appreciate about the game is how the music tells a story as well. Battle Music would
                        always differ from each colossus and even after you managed to defeat one you'd expect a more triumphant music right? well, The Music after defeating one 
                        colossi actually felt more, sad than you'd expect. To put in simply, it was as if you had taken someone else's life to save another, you might have saved
                        someone precious to you but you took someone else's life that is precious to someone else.
                    </p> <br>

                    </div> <br>

                    <p>
                        Shadow of the colossus is a great game and we would highly recommend it for everyone to try although few issues such as the camera control, the game being
                        repetitive because you will look for the colossus, slay the colossus then start back at the temple, this loop goes on everytime you successfully slay a 
                        colossi but even so, the game offers a unique experience that is immersive whenever you climb and find ever colossi's weaknesses, The story itself is great
                        but it is rather vague specially at the ending but we won't be spoiling that one. The Music is worth praising for giving a soul to the game, being motivated
                        and giving sympathy to the colossi as much as possible, Gameplay is neat and simple since it is mostly platforming to reach the colossi's weakpoints and
                        charging your blade to stab the sigils until the colossi falls.
