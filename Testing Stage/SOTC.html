            <p class="intro">
                Shadow of the Colossus is set in a fantasy world and follows Wander, a young man who travels to an isolated and abandoned section of the realm in search of the power to resurrect a girl named Mono. 
                The player takes on the role of Wander as he begins on a mission that could result in Mono's resurrection: find and destroy the colossi, 
                sixteen giant monsters scattered over the forbidden realm that the protagonist traverses by horseback and on foot.

                Fumito Ueda directed the game, which was developed at Sony Computer Entertainment's International Production Studio 1, 
                better known as Team Ico, the same development team behind the critically acclaimed PlayStation 2 title Ico, to which the game is regarded a spiritual sequel. 
                Shadow of the Colossus was originally planned as an online multiplayer game called NICO, but it was reworked as a single-player title after a protracted development cycle. 
                The team aimed to create an exceptional interactive experience by incorporating a distinctive visual design, 
                an unconventional gameplay structure, and non-player entities with powerful artificial intelligence, such as the colossi and Wander's horse, Agro.

                During their press conference at the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2017, Sony revealed a remake of Shadow of the Colossus for the PlayStation 4. 
                Bluepoint, who had previously worked on the PlayStation 3 remaster, was in charge of the remake
                The concept for a remake came from a chat between Bluepoint developers: they wanted to create a new definitive version of the original game, and it was agreed upon after communicating with friends at Sony Japan.
                In an interview with Game Informer, Bluepoint producer Randall Lowe and technical director Peter Dalton revealed that the original Shadow of the Colossus was on many of their workers' Top 5 all-time list.

                The developers rebuilt all of the game's assets from the ground up, yet the game keeps the original title's gameplay while introducing a new control scheme. 
                The game uses the original codebase from the PlayStation 2 game. To achieve comparability with the PlayStation 4 version, the art team used the PlayStation 2 version.
                The game was launched in North America on February 6, 2018, in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand on February 7, and in Japan on February 8.
